/* This file is solely for demonstration purposes.
 *
 *  Interrupts can for example be used to resume tasks that are waiting for
 *  a particular event to happen before they can run. Since interrupts can
 *  not be nested, the preferred way to handle external events is to start a
 *  high priority task by an interrupt and let the task take further action.
 *  Well, in fact interrupts could be nested, but this would take an excessive
 *  amount of ram, so we do not want to make use of it.
 *
 *  The interrupt pin drives a 4 bit counter. The value of the counter
 *  determines which leds are allowed to flash. If led Px4 is on, the blinker on
 *  Px0 is allowed to run, otherwise it is resumed. The way this works in detail
 *  depends on and varies with the setting of the configuration parameters.
 *
 *  Note that use for different devices requires different connection to the
 *  switches, because the location of INT0 cannot be altered by software.
